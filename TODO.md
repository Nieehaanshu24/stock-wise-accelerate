## Critical TODOs (Before Production Scale)

### 1. Thread Safety Review ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY

**Status**: Not addressed

**Issue**: Native C modules and file-based storage may have race conditions under concurrent load.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Review C code for thread-safe operations
  - [ ] Static variables in `stock_span.c`, `segment_tree.c`, `sliding_window.c`

- [ ] Test portfolio service under concurrent writes
  - [ ] Multiple users creating portfolios simultaneously
  - [ ] Race conditions in file I/O operations
- [ ] Test cache under concurrent access
  - [ ] File system locking for cache reads/writes
- [ ] Load testing with concurrent requests
  - [ ] Target: 100+ concurrent users
  - [ ] Monitor for deadlocks/corruption

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Priority**: HIGH - Required before multi-user production
